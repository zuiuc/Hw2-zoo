This is the Zoo app created by Qi Zhao for COEN 268 Spring 2016 at SCU.
The content is from zootopia, the movie. 
No special studio settings needed.
All the animal images are stored in res/Assets folder.The icon image and full-view images are different for my app. Full-view images are named as xxxxB.png.
All the other images are stored in res/drawable folder.
